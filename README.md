# LiFePO4 battery managment system

The BMS is based on the BQ7790521 from Texas Instruments.
- Overvoltage and undervoltage protection: Ensures the battery cells do not exceed their maximum voltage or fall below their minimum voltage.
- Overcurrent protection: Monitors current flow to prevent excessive current that could damage the battery.
- Temperature monitoring: Supports temperature sensors to ensure the battery stays within safe temperature limits.
- Cell balancing: Ensures even charge distribution across all cells in the battery pack.
- Fault detection and reporting: Includes functionality for detecting faults and providing diagnostic data for maintenance or troubleshooting.
